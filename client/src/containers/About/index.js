                                    Hi there <span role="img" aria-label="Hand Waving Emoji">ðŸ‘‹</span> My name is Nicolai Kozel, I'm the creator of Find Me Tabs.
                                    I currently work as a Full Stack Developer at Top Hat, an education tech company based in Toronto.
								</p>
								<p>
									This project pairs two of my biggest passions, music and coding. I've played Guitar for over 10 years
									and spent a lot of that time in a band writing, recording, and playing gigs.
									(You can check out one of our music videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktBSixcL1CE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!)
								</p>
								<p>
									One of the problems I've experienced over all these years is finding songs to learn that are both fun 
									and that I can get excited about. Whenever I looked for suggestions, all I could find were the same boring "Top 10" lists. Hence, Find Me Tabs was born! 
								</p>
								<p>
									I hope this site will help inspire you to play guitar and become a true rock god <span role="img" aria-label="Guitar Emoji">ðŸŽ¸</span>.
